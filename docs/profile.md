  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "UniversityLibraryProfile",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "abbreviation": {"type": "string"},

- abbreviation
- address
- phone
- email
- website
- director
- staff_fte
- founding_year
- total_items

- ir_url


### Templates & Forms

- Contact form template (title, name, email, dept, question)
- Repository deposit checklist (metadata, file formats, rights)
- Room booking form fields


### Quick FAQs for AI ingestion

- This `profile.md` is authoritative for library-wide metadata and policies. Always prefer the YAML front matter or JSON schema for structured lookups.
- For numerical KPIs use the `Assessment, Metrics & Reporting` section or append CSV/JSON files maintained by the library.
- For staff contacts, consult the `Contact Directory` appendix.


## AI Agent Usage Guide (how to feed another AI)

- Instruct the agent to parse front-matter YAML first for authoritative fields.
- For narrative queries (history, mission, services) use the human-readable sections.
- For structured tasks (populate a form, generate API payloads) use the JSON schema and CSV field list.
- If the consuming agent will make decisions (policy enforcement, access provisioning), require manual human review for any action that involves legal, financial, or privacy implications.

Example prompt for an AI agent:
"Load `profile.md`, parse YAML front matter as canonical metadata, index the `Collections` and `Services` sections, and produce a JSON object formatted to the included JSON schema. Flag missing required fields and output a checklist for human review."


## Versioning & Maintenance

- Owner: [Library Office / Data Steward]
- Review cadence: Quarterly updates; major review annually.

If you want, I can also:
- Pre-fill this file with values from existing pages in the site (for example [index.html](index.html) or [Repository.html](Repository.html)).
- Produce a machine-exportable JSON file following the schema above.
- Add an organizational chart image file and link it in the `Staffing & Roles` section.

**System Overview (from project README)**

University of Maiduguri Library Management System — a Django-based, modern library management platform that provides advanced cataloging, user management, analytics, circulation, and a responsive public interface. Core capabilities include catalog management (physical and digital copies), multi-tier membership, circulation automation, analytics dashboards, communication channels (email/SMS), repository and document management, and a REST API for integrations.

**Key Features (condensed)**

- Advanced Catalog Management: ISBN, authors, publishers, genres, multiple copies tracking, QR-code support, cover images, and full-text search with analytics.
- User Management: Multi-tier membership (students, faculty, public), patron profiles with QR IDs, staff directory, and role-based access control.
- Circulation: Loan management with due dates, renewals, reservations, automated notifications, overdue fines processing, and streamlined returns.
- Analytics & Reporting: Automated metrics generation, user analytics, system performance dashboards, and exportable reports.
- Communication: Email templates and automated notices; optional SMS integration for urgent alerts.
- Web & Content: Responsive Bootstrap front-end, blog/news system, event calendar, and document repository for file sharing.
- Technical: Django REST Framework API, Celery + Redis for background tasks, asset optimization, admin theming, and bulk import/export.

**Quick Start (developer-facing)**

Prerequisites: Python 3.8+, SQLite (dev) or production DB.

Typical steps to run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShedrackAmodu/Unimaid.git
cd library
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Local endpoints:
- Main site: http://localhost:8000
- Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin

**Configuration Notes**

- Email: supports SMTP/Gmail; both HTML and plain-text templates available.
- API: Django REST Framework with token auth, filtering and pagination; CORS config for front-end integrations.
- Background jobs: Celery + Redis recommended for async notifications and analytics processing.

**API Endpoints (examples)**

- `GET /api/books/` — list & filter books
- `POST /api/loans/` — create loans
- `GET /api/patrons/{id}/` — patron detail
- `GET /api/analytics/` — system analytics summary

Provide API tokens to external systems and require secure scopes for write actions.

**Usage by Role (summary)**

- Patrons: browse catalog, reserve books, manage loans and fines, access repository documents.
- Staff: manage circulation, catalog CRUD, patron management, moderation, and reporting.
- Admins: site configuration, user/role management, analytics, exports, and notification templates.

**User Stories & Flows (ingested from `user_story`)
— concise acceptance & flows for primary roles**

Regular Visitor
- Can view public content: home, catalog, staff, blogs, events, repository (public docs).
- Typical flow: open home → search/browse → open book/blog → view staff → download public repo docs.

Logged-in User
- Can authenticate, reserve books, view/renew loans, pay fines, and receive notifications.
- Typical flow: login → search book → reserve → dashboard → renew/pay fines.

Staff User
- Access staff dashboard: pending reservations, active loans, overdue items; perform checkouts/returns and catalog edits.
- Typical flow: login → open circulation dashboard → process requests → update catalog or patron records.

Admin User
- Full admin panel access for users, roles, settings, analytics, and exports. Destructive actions require confirmation and audit logs.

E-Library User
- Check in at terminals, access digital sessions, session tracking, and session history in dashboard.

Permissions Matrix (summary)

- Regular Visitor: read-only public pages.
- Logged-in User: personal actions (reserve, loans, renewals, fine payment).
- Staff User: catalog management, circulation processing, patron management.
- Admin User: full system control.

Acceptance & Testing Checklist (practical QA tasks)

- Verify public browsing and search without login.
- Verify login, dashboard, reservations, loan renewals, and fine payments.
- Verify staff actions: catalog CRUD, bulk checkouts/checkins, moderation.
- Verify admin exports, analytics, and notification sending.
- Verify API endpoints return expected payloads and enforce auth.

**Deployment & Production Guidance**

- Use a production-grade DB (PostgreSQL). Configure static/media hosting via a CDN or cloud storage.
- Run Celery workers with Redis (or alternative broker) for background jobs.
- Secure the app: enforce HTTPS, strong admin passwords, rotate API tokens, and enable logging/monitoring.

**Support & Acknowledgments**

- Support: library@unimaid.edu.ng and GitHub Issues (https://github.com/ShedrackAmodu/Unimaid/issues).
- Acknowledgments: University of Maiduguri, Django community, and open-source contributors.
